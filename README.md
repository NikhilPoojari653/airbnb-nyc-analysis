# 🏡 Airbnb NYC Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Objective
Analyze 36K+ Airbnb listings in New York City to explore trends in pricing, availability, room types, and host behavior using real-world data.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (KMeans)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Highlights
- Removed outliers (price > $1000)
- Converted string-based prices to float
- Filled missing values
- Used `neighbourhood_cleansed` and `reviews_per_month`

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Listings by borough and room type
- Price distributions and boxplots
- Host behavior analysis (multi-listing hosts)
- Availability trends (365-day flag)
- Review score impact on pricing
- KMeans clustering of host behavior

## 📈 Business Insights
- Manhattan listings dominate pricing and volume
- 365-day listings likely indicate commercial hosts
- Price and review scores show weak correlation
- Room types vary significantly by borough

## 📎 Project Impact
- Real-world EDA practice on a large dataset
- Cleaned & visualized complex data using Python
- Demonstrated end-to-end storytelling from raw data to insights
